    The following lists and describes commands to be used with the current TaskManager
    program.

    add     enters a wizard that prompts you to enter in succession: the new task's title,
            priority and due date in the format dd/mm/yy (or yyyy) + optionally time in the
            format hh:mm. Separators can be dots (`.`) and year is optional altogether if
            it's equal to the current one. Alternatively, the due date can be set relatively
            to the current time by typing "in dd:hh:mm" (days are optional). If nothing is
            entered, priority defaults to NONE.

    edit    enters the same wizard as "add", preceded by an ask for in ID. After the wizard
            is done, overwrites the existing entry with the given ID.

    subtask enters the same wizard as "edit", but the new task is generated as a subtask
            of the one given by the supplied ID.

    delete  asks for an ID and deletes the corresponding (sub)task.

    complete asks for an ID and marks the corresponding (sub)task as complete.

    TODO:
    label <id>      prompts the user to enter a label to be assigned to the task with ID
                    <id>.
    TODO label
    show <label>    when used with no argument, displays all tasks and their subtasks in a
                    hierarchy, along with their IDs. When a label is given, shows only
                    (sub)tasks with this label.

    help    shows this help.
